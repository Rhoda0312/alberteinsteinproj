                <h2> Albert Einstein Biography</h2>
                <p>lbert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.

                    During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, 
                    he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed 
                    Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, 
                    in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the 
                    following year to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser 
                    Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. He became a German 
                    citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for 
                    political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical
                     Physics at Princeton*. He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post 
                     in 1945.

            <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
            <p>I have a variety of hobbies and interests outside of work as a physicist. But Here are Some of my favorite
                pastimes included:
            </p>

            <h3><br>Playing the Violin</h3>
            <p>Einstein was an accomplished violinist and began playing at a young age. He continued to play
                throughout his life and was known to enjoy performing classical music in his spare time.
            </p>

            <h3><br>Sailing</h3>
            <p>Einstein loved to sail and owned a boat named Tümmler. He would often spend weekends on the water,
                enjoying the peacefulness and beauty of nature.
            </p>

            <h3><br>Traveling</h3>
            <p>Einstein was an avid traveler and visited many countries throughout his lifetime. He was particularly
                fascinated by Asia and the Middle East, and often incorporated his travels into his work as a
                physicist.
            </p>

            <h3><br>Reading</h3>
            <p>Einstein was an avid reader and had a personal library of over 2,000 books. He was interested in a
                wide range of subjects, from science and philosophy to literature and history.
            </p>

            <h3><br>Writing</h3>
            <p>Einstein enjoyed writing about his scientific theories and philosophical ideas. He also wrote letters
                to friends and colleagues, some of which have been published in collections.

            <h1>INVENTIONS</h1>
            
            <h3> Theory of Special Relativity: </h3>
            <p>Einstein's theory of special relativity, published in 1905, 
                introduced the concept that the laws of physics are the same for 
                all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light in a 
                vacuum is a constant for all observers. This theory laid the foundation 
                for the famous equation E=mc², which demonstrates the equivalence of mass and energy. 
            </p>
            <h3> Theory of General Relativity </h3>
            <p> In 1915, Einstein developed the theory of general relativity, 
                which expanded on his earlier work and provided a new understanding of gravity. 
                According to this theory, massive objects like planets and stars cause spacetime 
                to curve around them, resulting in the gravitational force. 
            </p>
            <h3> Photoelectric Effect </h3>
            <p>  In 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect, 
                which occurs when light strikes a material and releases electrons. 
                His explanation, based on the quantization of light energy,
                 played a pivotal role in the development of quantum mechanics.
            </p>
            <h3> Einstein Refrigerator: </h3>
            <p> Although he is not primarily known for this invention, 
                Einstein and his former student, Leo Szilard, patented an innovative and 
                environmentally friendly refrigerator design in 1930. This refrigerator used 
                ammonia, butane, and water as coolants and did not rely on harmful chemicals like 
                the conventional refrigerators of the time.
            </p>
            <h3> Brownian Motion: </h3>
            <p>  In 1905, Einstein provided a theoretical explanation for the erratic 
                motion of small particles suspended in a fluid, known as Brownian motion. 
                His work on this phenomenon provided strong evidence for the existence of atoms 
                and molecules and furthered our understanding of statistical mechanics.
